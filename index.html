                         Hi Gwynne! It's hard to believe it's been three years since you graciously took the time out of your busy schedule to do an AMA with us at Hack Club. I truly enjoyed co-hosting that event. During it, you shared the wisdom, "To be successful, you need to be able to listen." I've taken that advice to heart, and since then, I've led teams of girls in hosting hackathons and events where they mentor other girls in coding. Thank you for your generosity and for supporting our work.

                         Hi Gwynne! It means so much to me to have your support on Hack Club’s  initiative to reach more girls and get them to code. I took a gap year after high school in India and moved to Vermont to work on this project, so knowing I am directly being supported by you makes this all the more fulfilling :)
