            Hi Gwynne! It's hard to believe it's been three years since you
            graciously took the time out of your busy schedule to do an AMA with
            us at Hack Club. I truly enjoyed co-hosting that event. During it,
            you shared the wisdom, "To be successful, you need to be able to
            listen." I've taken that advice to heart, and since then, I've led
            teams of girls in hosting hackathons and events where they mentor
            other girls in coding. Thank you for your generosity and for
            supporting our work.

            Hi Gwynne! It means so much to me to have your support on Hack
            Clubâ€™s initiative to reach more girls and get them to code. I took a
            gap year after high school in India and moved to Vermont to work on
            this project, so knowing I am directly being supported by you makes
            this all the more fulfilling :)

            Hey Gwynne!! I'm Savina Jabbo, a 16 year-old hacker from San
            Diego. Your leadership at SpaceX and support for Days of Service
            inspire me everyday to take risks and pursue and share my love for
            space and coding. Thank you for empowering more girls to join this
            incredible journey and helping them learn the fundamental skill of
            not only coding but also confidence in their abilities to change the
            world.

            Hi Gwynne! 
Your wisdom in listening and observing has been a beacon in my journey.
Hack Club helped me find my voice in tech, and letting us collaborate on amazing projects with friends across the globe.
Working on Lonestar the first post-pandemic Girl Scouts hackathon in Texas was not just an event but a celebration of resilience and renewed passion for tech. 
This milestone was made possible by your foundation of support and inspiration.
Every line of code written, every girl empowered, echoes your belief in our potential! 
Days of Service has been a testament to the power of community and the impact of mentorship in South Texas and all over the nation. 
Thank you for being the lighthouse guiding us in uncharted waters,
 making the world brighter for future tech enthusiasts, 
 one girl at a time. ðŸ’–

            Hi Gwynne, I started learning to code through friends at Hack Club
            and have now built sites seen by hundreds of thousands of people.
            It's such a magical feeling, thanks for creating this for more
            people :)

            The Days of Service has served as a platform to inspire the next
            generation of girls and gender minorities in Computer Science, and
            I'm grateful for the opportunity to partake in the journey with
            them. From learning their first "Hello Worlds" to shipping a
            project, the Days of Service initiative has enabled students to
            approach CS with more confidence and passion. Thank you for
            supporting Hack Club's endeavors to diversity the STEM workforce! My
            favorite memory from the Days-of-Service was a conversation with a
            Girl Scout at Lonestar -- our San Antonio event. Over lunch, we sat
            together and talked about our passions, and the conversation
            inspired her to take an issue she deeply cared about (Climate
            Change) and develop a website for her Silver Award educating others
            about it. The Days of Service provided her, in addition to countless
            others across the nation, with the superpower to create positive
            change in her community.

            hi gwynne! you're super inspiring and i wanted to say thank you for
            supporting days of service. recently we were able to host Blossom
            :cherry_blossom: : the largest gender-focused hackathon in atlanta
            for middle school girl scouts! it was a huge success and i'm glad we
            were able to inspire so many young girls who had never touched code
            before to leave the event with the confidence that they had a place
            in the world of technology.
